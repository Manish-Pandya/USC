| User Training Profile - Initial
------------------------------
User is presented with all root-level Profile Questions
As each yes/no question is answered, additional questions are presented as necessary
Upon submission, Course assignments are made, the profile is marked as Copmlete, and is given a renewal date

| User Training Profile - Amendments
------------------------------
User can amend their current Profile by submitting a new profile
Existing answers are pre-filled, but any changes are stored as a new profile
Changes to course assignments will be made:
    * New responses which result in course assignments are handled normally (user is assigned to Course)
    * Response changes which result in a course no longer being assigned are handled specially:
    ** If user has not yet started the Course, the assignment is removed
    ** If user has started the Course, the assignment is kept (perhaps no longer required?)
