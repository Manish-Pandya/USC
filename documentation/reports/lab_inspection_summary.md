# Lab Inspection Summary Report
The Lab Inspection Summary provides a real-time report of the status of Inspections within a Department for a specified calendar year.
The Department constraint is selected based on the User viewing the Report. Administrative users will be able to select the department which should be shown.

## Report Table
Principal Investigator
Inspection Date
Lab Inspection Status
Compliance Score (score displayed in post-inspection report)
Inspection Report (link or 'n/a')

# Details received from EHS prior to development:
Add a Department Chair “Role” in the User Hub.  

The lab inspection summary report table should include the following separate columns: Principal Investigator, Inspection Date, Lab Inspection Status, Compliance Score, Inspection Report (link).  The inspection status report should include all departmental labs, so if some labs have not yet been inspected, then “Inspection Scheduled” should be indicated in the Lab Inspection Status and the Report column will indicate “N/A”.  If a lab has an overdue CAP, the Inspection Status of “Overdue Corrective Actions” should be highlighted in the table field.  Above the table should include the title “Laboratory Safety Inspection Summary Report”.  Below the title at the top of the page should include, for example:

    Department: Chemistry and Biochemistry
    Chair:  Ken Shimizu

The Chair will continue to have access to this summary report that is automatically updated as the status changes, so the Chair can monitor the compliance status of each PI and easily identify any PI that still has not submitted their corrective action plan. EH&S will need an administrative screen to view exactly what each Department Chair sees.  This can be a page that includes a drop-down menu at the top where EH&S can select a department.  When the department is selected, the applicable department summary report/heading displays. 

### Automatic email sent when 80% of the PIs in the department have been inspected (at least 1 room for each PI – it’s possible we might not inspect a specific lab room for some reason).

    Dear Department Chair,

    The EH&S Office of Research Safety conducts annual laboratory safety inspections in all research laboratories.  Following the inspection, each laboratory receives a report that documents any safety or compliance deficiencies that were identified.  The PI is requested to submit a corrective action plan for each safety or compliance deficiency identified within two weeks.  According to University policy, EH&S must escalate laboratories with overdue corrective actions to the Department Chair for resolution.  The Chair is responsible for ensuring that all PIs in their department submit their corrective action plan or the Chair can take actions deemed appropriate to ensure these safety or compliance issues are resolved (e.g. notify the Dean).  

    EH&S has prepared a lab safety inspection summary report that includes each PI’s laboratory in your department.  Any PI with an overdue corrective action plan is highlighted in the report. This report is automatically updated as the inspection status for labs in your department changes, so you can verify the submission status of each lab’s corrective action plan at any time.  Most of the lab inspections in your department have been completed.  You can access your department’s laboratory safety inspection summary report at the following link: ______

    We appreciate your willingness to promote research safety and compliance in your department’s laboratories. Additional information on the EH&S laboratory safety inspection policies and procedures is on our website at https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/ehs/research_and_laboratory_safety/chemical_and_lab_safety/lab_safety_inspections/index.php.   

    Best regards,

### Automatic email sent on December 1st each year (Note: EHS tries to complete all lab inspections by December 1st each year so labs have adequate time to implement corrective actions before end of year.)
